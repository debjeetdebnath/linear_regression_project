Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Data¶
Let us first import NumPy and Pandas and read the housing dataset

# Supress Warnings

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
housing = pd.read_csv("Housing.csv")
# Check the head of the dataset
housing.head()

Step 2: Visualising the Data
Let's now spend some time doing what is arguably the most important step - understanding the data.

If there is some obvious multicollinearity going on, this is the first place to catch it
Here's where you'll also identify if some predictors directly have a strong association with the outcome variable
We'll visualise our data using matplotlib and seaborn.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-2a34e7750742> in <module>
----> 1 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      2 import seaborn as sns

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'

Visualising Numeric Variables
Let's make a pairplot of all the numeric variables

sns.pairplot(housing)
plt.show()
Visualising Categorical Variables
As you might have noticed, there are a few categorical variables as well. Let's make a boxplot for some of these variables.

plt.figure(figsize=(20, 12))
plt.subplot(2,3,1)
sns.boxplot(x = 'mainroad', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,2)
sns.boxplot(x = 'guestroom', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,3)
sns.boxplot(x = 'basement', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,4)
sns.boxplot(x = 'hotwaterheating', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,5)
sns.boxplot(x = 'airconditioning', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,6)
sns.boxplot(x = 'furnishingstatus', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.show()
We can also visualise some of these categorical features parallely by using the hue argument. Below is the plot for furnishingstatus with airconditioning as the hue.

plt.figure(figsize = (10, 5))
sns.boxplot(x = 'furnishingstatus', y = 'price', hue = 'airconditioning', data = housing)
plt.show()
Step 3: Data Preparation
You can see that your dataset has many columns with values as 'Yes' or 'No'.

But in order to fit a regression line, we would need numerical values and not string. Hence, we need to convert them to 1s and 0s, where 1 is a 'Yes' and 0 is a 'No'.

# List of variables to map
​
varlist =  ['mainroad', 'guestroom', 'basement', 'hotwaterheating', 'airconditioning', 'prefarea']
​
# Defining the map function
def binary_map(x):
    return x.map({'yes': 1, "no": 0})
​
# Applying the function to the housing list
housing[varlist] = housing[varlist].apply(binary_map)
# Check the housing dataframe now
​
housing.head()
Dummy Variables
The variable furnishingstatus has three levels. We need to convert these levels into integer as well.

For this, we will use something called dummy variables.

# Get the dummy variables for the feature 'furnishingstatus' and store it in a new variable - 'status'
status = pd.get_dummies(housing['furnishingstatus'])
# Check what the dataset 'status' looks like
status.head()
Now, you don't need three columns. You can drop the furnished column, as the type of furnishing can be identified with just the last two columns where —

00 will correspond to furnished
01 will correspond to unfurnished
10 will correspond to semi-furnished
# Let's drop the first column from status df using 'drop_first = True'
​
status = pd.get_dummies(housing['furnishingstatus'], drop_first = True)
status
# Add the results to the original housing dataframe
​
housing = pd.concat([housing, status], axis = 1)
# Now let's see the head of our dataframe.
​
housing.head()
# Drop 'furnishingstatus' as we have created the dummies for it
​
housing.drop(['furnishingstatus'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
housing.head()
Step 4: Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
As you know, the first basic step for regression is performing a train-test split.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
​
# We specify this so that the train and test data set always have the same rows, respectively
np.random.seed(0)
df_train, df_test = train_test_split(housing, train_size = 0.7, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 100)
print (df_train.shape)
print (df_test.shape)
Rescaling the Features
As you saw in the demonstration for Simple Linear Regression, scaling doesn't impact your model. Here we can see that except for area, all the columns have small integer values. So it is extremely important to rescale the variables so that they have a comparable scale. If we don't have comparable scales, then some of the coefficients as obtained by fitting the regression model might be very large or very small as compared to the other coefficients. This might become very annoying at the time of model evaluation. So it is advised to use standardization or normalization so that the units of the coefficients obtained are all on the same scale. As you know, there are two common ways of rescaling:

Min-Max scaling
Standardisation (mean-0, sigma-1)
This time, we will use MinMax scaling.

from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
# Apply scaler() to all the columns except the 'yes-no' and 'dummy' variables
num_vars = ['area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'parking','price']
​
df_train[num_vars] = scaler.fit_transform(df_train[num_vars])
df_train.head()
df_train.describe()
# Let's check the correlation coefficients to see which variables are highly correlated
​
plt.figure(figsize = (16, 10))
sns.heatmap(df_train.corr(), annot = True, cmap="YlGnBu")
plt.show()
As you might have noticed, area seems to the correlated to price the most. Let's see a pairplot for area vs price.

plt.figure(figsize=[6,6])
plt.scatter(df_train.area, df_train.price)
plt.show()
So, we pick area as the first variable and we'll try to fit a regression line to that.

Dividing into X and Y sets for the model building
y_train = df_train.pop('price')
X_train = df_train
X_train
Step 5: Building a linear model
Fit a regression line through the training data using statsmodels. Remember that in statsmodels, you need to explicitly fit a constant using sm.add_constant(X) because if we don't perform this step, statsmodels fits a regression line passing through the origin, by default.

import statsmodels.api as sm
​
# Add a constant
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train[['area']])
​
# Create a first fitted model
lr = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()
# Check the parameters obtained
​
lr.params
# Let's visualise the data with a scatter plot and the fitted regression line
plt.scatter(X_train_lm.iloc[:, 1], y_train)
plt.plot(X_train_lm.iloc[:, 1], 0.127 + 0.462*X_train_lm.iloc[:, 1], 'r')
plt.show()
# Print a summary of the linear regression model obtained
print(lr.summary())
Adding another variable
The R-squared value obtained is 0.283. Since we have so many variables, we can clearly do better than this. So let's go ahead and add the second most highly correlated variable, i.e. bathrooms.

# Assign all the feature variables to X
X_train_lm = X_train[['area', 'bathrooms']]
# Build a linear model
​
import statsmodels.api as sm
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train_lm)
​
lr = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()
​
lr.params
# Check the summary
print(lr.summary())
We have clearly improved the model as the value of adjusted R-squared as its value has gone up to 0.477 from 0.281. Let's go ahead and add another variable, bedrooms.

# Assign all the feature variables to X
X_train_lm = X_train[['area', 'bathrooms','bedrooms']]
# Build a linear model
​
import statsmodels.api as sm
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train_lm)
​
lr = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()
​
lr.params
# Print the summary of the model
​
print(lr.summary())
We have improved the adjusted R-squared again. Now let's go ahead and add all the feature variables.

Adding all the variables to the model
# Check all the columns of the dataframe
​
housing.columns
#Build a linear model
​
import statsmodels.api as sm
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train)
​
lr_1 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()
​
lr_1.params
print(lr_1.summary())
Looking at the p-values, it looks like some of the variables aren't really significant (in the presence of other variables).

Maybe we could drop some?

We could simply drop the variable with the highest, non-significant p value. A better way would be to supplement this with the VIF information.

Checking VIF
Variance Inflation Factor or VIF, gives a basic quantitative idea about how much the feature variables are correlated with each other. It is an extremely important parameter to test our linear model. The formula for calculating VIF is:

𝑉𝐼𝐹𝑖=11−𝑅𝑖2
# Check for the VIF values of the feature variables. 
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
# Create a dataframe that will contain the names of all the feature variables and their respective VIFs
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X_train.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X_train.values, i) for i in range(X_train.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif
We generally want a VIF that is less than 5. So there are clearly some variables we need to drop.

Dropping the variable and updating the model
As you can see from the summary and the VIF dataframe, some variables are still insignificant. One of these variables is, semi-furnished as it has a very high p-value of 0.938. Let's go ahead and drop this variables

# Dropping highly correlated variables and insignificant variables
​
X = X_train.drop('semi-furnished', 1,)
# Build a third fitted model
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X)
​
lr_2 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()
# Print the summary of the model
print(lr_2.summary())
# Calculate the VIFs again for the new model
​
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif
Dropping the Variable and Updating the Model
As you can notice some of the variable have high VIF values as well as high p-values. Such variables are insignificant and should be dropped.

As you might have noticed, the variable bedroom has a significantly high VIF (6.6) and a high p-value (0.206) as well. Hence, this variable isn't of much use and should be dropped.

# Dropping highly correlated variables and insignificant variables
X = X.drop('bedrooms', 1)
# Build a second fitted model
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X)
​
lr_3 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()
# Print the summary of the model
​
print(lr_3.summary())
# Calculate the VIFs again for the new model
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif
Dropping the variable and updating the model
As you might have noticed, dropping semi-furnised decreased the VIF of mainroad as well such that it is now under 5. But from the summary, we can still see some of them have a high p-value. basement for instance, has a p-value of 0.03. We should drop this variable as well.

X = X.drop('basement', 1)
# Build a fourth fitted model
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X)
​
lr_4 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()
print(lr_4.summary())
# Calculate the VIFs again for the new model
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif
Now as you can see, the VIFs and p-values both are within an acceptable range. So we go ahead and make our predictions using this model only.

Step 7: Residual Analysis of the train data
So, now to check if the error terms are also normally distributed (which is infact, one of the major assumptions of linear regression), let us plot the histogram of the error terms and see what it looks like.

y_train_price = lr_4.predict(X_train_lm)
# Plot the histogram of the error terms
fig = plt.figure()
sns.distplot((y_train - y_train_price), bins = 20)
fig.suptitle('Error Terms', fontsize = 20)                  # Plot heading 
plt.xlabel('Errors', fontsize = 18)                         # X-label
Step 8: Making Predictions Using the Final Model
Now that we have fitted the model and checked the normality of error terms, it's time to go ahead and make predictions using the final, i.e. fourth model.

Applying the scaling on the test sets
num_vars = ['area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'parking','price']
​
df_test[num_vars] = scaler.transform(df_test[num_vars])
df_test.describe()
Dividing into X_test and y_test
y_test = df_test.pop('price')
X_test = df_test
# Adding constant variable to test dataframe
X_test_m4 = sm.add_constant(X_test)
# Creating X_test_m4 dataframe by dropping variables from X_test_m4
​
X_test_m4 = X_test_m4.drop(["bedrooms", "semi-furnished", "basement"], axis = 1)
# Making predictions using the fourth model
​
y_pred_m4 = lr_4.predict(X_test_m4)
Step 9: Model Evaluation
Let's now plot the graph for actual versus predicted values.

# Plotting y_test and y_pred to understand the spread
​
fig = plt.figure()
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred_m4)
fig.suptitle('y_test vs y_pred', fontsize = 20)              # Plot heading 
plt.xlabel('y_test', fontsize = 18)                          # X-label
plt.ylabel('y_pred', fontsize = 16)      
We can see that the equation of our best fitted line is:

𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒=0.236×𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎+0.202×𝑏𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑠+0.11×𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠+0.05×𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑟𝑜𝑎𝑑+0.04×𝑔𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑚+0.0876×ℎ𝑜𝑡𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔+0.0682×𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔+0.0629×𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔+0.0637×𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎−0.0337×𝑢𝑛𝑓𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑑
Overall we have a decent model, but we also acknowledge that we could do better.

We have a couple of options:

Add new features (bathrooms/bedrooms, area/stories, etc.)
Build a non-linear model
